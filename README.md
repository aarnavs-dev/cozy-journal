# 🌿 Unsent Journal

A small, cozy journaling web app built to create **space between impulse and action** — especially during emotionally difficult moments.

Instead of texting someone you miss or reaching out in a vulnerable moment, this app gives you a **gentle place to write what you feel**, without sending it. The goal is to express the emotion safely, let the urge pass, and reflect when you're ready.

This project started as a personal healing tool — and grew into something meaningful.

## 🎯 Why This Exists

Breakups and emotional transitions can make you feel an urge to reach out — even when you’ve mutually decided to take space.

This app acts as a **buffer**:

Instead of pressing *send*,  
you write what you wanted to say —  
and you keep it here.

You still honor the feeling,  
but you **honor your boundaries too**.

💛 A Note
This project was created during a vulnerable time — as a way to process feelings with kindness instead of impulse.

If you’re going through something similar:

You’re not alone.
You’re allowed to feel.
And you’re allowed to take space.

Take care 🌿
